# How to update
When adding a new folder please write up about it in the correct README.md and also ask for permission with folders (this is so that we don't end up with clutter, you will most likely be allowed to add it). 

# Stack
- GUI
  - Python 3.9.13
  - PYQT6
- Radio
  - C++
 
## Python Version
We are going to be using **python 3.9.13** so please install that on your computer either in the microsoft store or from pythons website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Please try to use a virtual environment when programming, if you don't know how to do this please message me (Julian)! Name the folder either "env" or "venv" so its in the .gitignore as we don't want to be uploading that to github.
